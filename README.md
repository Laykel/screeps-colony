# Screeps code

See [screeps' site](https://screeps.com/) for more information.

The code for my colony of Creeps, in typescript thanks to [this project](https://github.com/screepers/typed-screeps).

Note that with this simple setup, the source files can't be put in folders. Every module has to stay at the root of `src`.

Also note that the `build` directory `tsc` builds to is a symbolic link on my machine, pointing to `$HOME/.config/Screeps/scripts/screeps.com/main/*`.
